                        <h3>First Trial</h3>
                        <p>In the last week, I learned to maneuver through my terminal with more ease. This allows me to build a nice base for the coming topics. I have yet to perfect it, however, I do feel more confident when playing within command line. I mean playing quite literally, as I had no idea what I was doing, so, in order to get familiar, especially when having to push to GitHub, I often created ridiculous file and directory names in order to amuse myself, which I think kept some of the demons at bay. Setting the Stage is a bit more difficult for me, but I am working to be more organized and less distracted. The way I set the stage in the following video is by nixing my distractions, such as: logging out of Facebook, iMessages, Gmail, closing extra tabs, including news articles, and evening turning off Slack notifications, as I can often get lost in the soundmedicine channel. Once I eliminate my distractions, work and play are much easier to accomplish. I hope to apply the new technology and skills to become a more well rounded developer.</p>

                        <h3>Second Trial</h3>
                        <p>Yesterday, I learned the beginnings of GitHub. This is extremely helpful, as now I can collaborate with other developers on upcoming projects. Each day I begin my work, I must set the stage in order to focus on the task at hand. I do this by getting onto Trello and laying out my goals for today. After that, I set aside all distractions, including but not limitied to logging out of iMessages. Once I do that, I get into GitHub and create some new repositories. I like to play with repository titles, some funny and some serious, and practice pushing and pulling.</p>

                        <h3>Third Trial</h3>
                        <p>Today was a goal setting and accomplishing day. To set the stage, I came to campus and got into Trello. There were two things that I want to accomplish today, keeping in mind how attainable these goals are. I put into Trello that I want to finish my Github drills and to get a basic understanding of html and CSS. I set the stage by first getting on Trello and reading through the instructions for the drills. After that, I closed out all distractions, including but not limited to the soundmedicine channel on Slack. The way I played, was by throwing in some goals on Trello's to do list that were outside of my web development work, like: improving the fort when I return to Wisconsin that I built for my nephews in my sister's woods. I hunted down a classmate that just went through html, and got him to walk me through the way to connect my html and css files. Then he walked me through basic tags, and I learned to create a very simple static website. I also attended two breakouts on the same topic. I took some time after this to play around in Atom with html and CSS. Now, I feel more capable of creating a few basic, person websites. Goal setting and time management are key. These two tools I will continue to work on.</p>
