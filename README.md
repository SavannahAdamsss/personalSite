# Personal Site, a Work in Progress: May 2018

## This Site is a Representation of Where My Skill Level was When I First Began to Develop Websites

* This is a website built in December of 2017 during a six month web development immersive program. This was the very first website I created. Instead of cleaning up the code and content, I decided to leave it as is, so one can follow the progression of my work over the last six months.

* Built with HTML and CSS and deployed with Surge, you may view this site at: <erratic-lip.surge.sh>

* To host this site locally, one may clone the repository and run lite-server or live-server from the terminal.
