                        <img class="wrap"src="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21767994_1907822699483038_8755995740852987772_n.jpg?oh=d0921c8717db2d26b63c7fea5bfa911a&oe=5AF063FC">
                        <p>I am many things.  I am a middle child of seven from the Midwest.  I am a lifelong student, a puzzle solver, a story teller, and I am gifted with the ability to comfortably talk with anyone.  Aside from my family, my two most favorite things are language and travel.  I have studied four languages and have begun a fifth. Traveling has allowed me to explore my love of languages at a deeper level.  I love learning about cultures, and I love to hear the stories of others.  For the past year, I have had the privilege of traveling twenty-six countries while living out of a backpack.  Exploring so many different places and cultures has provided me a new perspective on humanity.  I find more beauty in the differences among humans.  I consider this a sort of salvation, and I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything.</p>

                        <p>Now, I find myself in Denver working towards the title of Full Stack Web Developer.  After being on the move for so long, I find it difficult to stay put.  It took me some time to adjust to my new schedule.  So how can I be successful without some sort of tool to keep my mind focused on my new goal?  Fortunately, there are some simple tools that, if properly deployed, create a more organized and efficient me.  Taking a few minutes each morning to set the stage for my day allows me to time-manage with ease, accomplishing my goals with precision.  Goal setting is key in this process.  A list of attainable goals, creates a mindset of determination.  Be it daily, short-term goals or that goal off in the distance, checking off those to-do's brings pride and discipline, and when one is proud of the work being accomplished, procrastination doesn't stand a chance. </p>
