                        <h3>First Trial</h3>
                        <p>On December 12, 2017, I attended the Denver Devs Happy Hour at PS303.  There I met David Pinto from GroupHigh, a public relations and marketing software provider located in Boulder, CO.  David is a chief technical officer.  I learned later more what this type of job entails.  He monitor and selects new technology that can be applied to the company product.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Matt Boknevitz from Akamai, a cloud delivery platform located in Denver, CO.  He referred to his position as a solutions architect.  I learned from him that in web security, Python is widely used.  Then he went into some Python jargon that I could not follow.  My question is: is Python something that we should consider learning?</p>

                        <h3>Second Trial</h3>
                        <p>On December 13, 2017, I attended a UX meet-up at the Irish Snug.  There, I met a senior software developer named Don Abrams at InVisionApp Inc.  He told me it is good to be at Galvanize rather than some of the other boot camps in Denver, because Galvanize teaches front and back end.  Something I learned from him last night is that front end will be dead in two years.  I also met a UX developer called Steven Winkelstein.  He currently studies at General Assembly in Denver.  He told me that he wants to be the next Walt Disney.  The rest of the time, he told me of all his future plans and then swore me to secrecy. What I took away from him is that there are so many creative directions one can go in this industry.  A question: Is it possible that front end development is dying, or rather becoming obsolete?</p>

                        <h3>Third Trial</h3>
                        <p>12/11/17 Friday, I moved onto my second and third Git/GitHub drills. I wanted to finish the last two Git drills by the end of the day. Git/GitHub drills were set for the cohort to finish by the end of Friday. I did not complete the Git/GitHub drills, so I did not accomplish my goals, which was not a win. However, I will stay as long as it takes to finish this goal today. One win I can consider is that I have spent a bit more time on the drills, which is helping to solidify the steps in my mind. Friday, I began with setting the stage by writing out a list of my distractions that I could get to later in the evening. I focused on the task at hand, while taking breaks from time to time. It would have been more realistic to set the goal to be completed by Monday, rather than Friday, in order to have a bit more practice in GitHub. Today, I have set more realistic goals for the time I have to work. Time management is key.</p>
