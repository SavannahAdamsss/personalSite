                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>So begins the blog of me.  I am many things.  I am a middle child of seven from the Midwest.  I am a lifelong student.  I am a puzzle lover, and I am gifted with the ability to comfortably talk with anyone.  Aside from my family, my two most favorite things are language and travel.  I have studied four languages, including my own, and am beginning a fifth.  Those languages are: English, Spanish, French, German, and Polish, in that order.  Studying languages has pushed me around the world and into different academic opportunities.  Iâ€™ve been to twenty-eight countries, have a bachelor of arts in applied linguistics, and am completing my certification in full stack development.</p>

                <h3>Re-entry</h3>
                <p>While I complete my web development program, I keep a rigorous schedule, to which I am not accustomed.  Prior to moving to Denver and attending Galvanize, I had a very flexible schedule and lived out of a backpack for two years.  I have had to relearn to keep a proper schedule.  This I have done using some basic organizational skills of goal setting and learning to learn again.  Please see the menu bar to read more on that.</p>
