                        <h3>First Trial</h3>
                        <p>Yesterday, I came in and listed some attainable goals in Trello.  I decided to finish my learn to learn drills and to move onto my second and third Git/GitHub drills. I wanted to finish all three learn to learn drills and the last two Git drills by the end of the day.  I wanted to get some of the softer drills out of the way, so that I am ready to focus on more difficult tasks.  I did complete my learn to learn drills and began working on the Git drills.  I did accomplish my learn to learn goals yesterday, which was a win. However, I did not complete my Git drills. I began with setting the stage by writing out a list of my distractions that I could get to later in the evening. I focused on my work while taking breaks from time to time. It was unrealistic to expect to complete the Git drills, because I did not have as much time as I thought to put into all the drills.  Today, I have set more realistic goals for the time I have to work. Time management is key.</p>

                        <h3>Second Trial</h3>
                        <p>Yesterday, I came in and listed some attainable goals in Trello.  I began with setting the stage by writing out a list of my distractions that I could get to later in the evening.  I wanted to finish my second and third Git/GitHub drills.  I focused on my work while taking breaks from time to time.  I did complete these drills, but it actually took me another day and a half.  Because I did not complete my Git drills in the time I had planned, I felt like that was a loss.  I have determined to set more realistic goals for the time I have to work on them.  I want to become a better estimator of the time it takes in each type of project, which I know will come with more experience. It was unrealistic to expect to complete the Git drills, because I did not have as much time as I thought to put into all the drills.  Time management is key to being successful.</p>

                        <h3>Third Trial</h3>
                        <p>12/11/17 Friday, I moved onto my second and third Git/GitHub drills. I wanted to finish the last two Git drills by the end of the day. Git/GitHub drills were set for the cohort to finish by the end of Friday. I did not complete the Git/GitHub drills, so I did not accomplish my goals, which was not a win. However, I will stay as long as it takes to finish this goal today. One win I can consider is that I have spent a bit more time on the drills, which is helping to solidify the steps in my mind. Friday, I began with setting the stage by writing out a list of my distractions that I could get to later in the evening. I focused on the task at hand, while taking breaks from time to time. It would have been more realistic to set the goal to be completed by Monday, rather than Friday, in order to have a bit more practice in GitHub. Today, I have set more realistic goals for the time I have to work. Time management is key.</p>
